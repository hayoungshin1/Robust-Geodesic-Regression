# Robust-Geodesic-Regression

Code for the numerical experiments in Section 4.1 of the paper 'Robust Geodesic Regression' by Ha-Young Shin and Hee-Seok Oh. 

## Requirements

The '[GeodRegr](https://github.com/hayoungshin1/GeodRegr)' package is required, as are 'MASS', 'mvtnorm', 'R.matlab' and 'rmatio'.

## Guide

- `simulation_experiments_1.R` contains the code for the simulation experiments on the sphere 
$S^n$ and hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ for type $N$, $T$ and $C$ errors. The output is the MSEs for $p$ and $v^j$. Under initializations, the dimension, the number of independent variables $k$ and the type of M-type estimator can be changed.

- `simulation_experiments_2.R` contains the code for the simulation experiments on the sphere $S^n$ and hyperbolic space 
$\mathbb{H}^n$ for various values of $\sigma$. 
The output is the sample variance for $p$. Under initializations, the dimension, the number of independent variables $k$ and the type of M-type  estimator can be changed.

- `kendall_experiments.R` contains the code for the experiments on Kendall's 2-dimensional shape space. The type of M-type estimator can be changed under the initializations section. We have used the preprocessed data provided by Cornea and Zhu on their [website]( http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/bias/software.html) under the title 'Regression Models on Riemannian Symmetric Spaces'.
